<h1>Hello. This is <u>multivocal</u>, a project exploring representation, identity and aesthetics of synthesized voices</h1>

<h2>You can contribute by <a href="/contribute-voice">adding your voice</a> or <a href="/rate-voices">rating existing recordings</a>.</h2>


<p>What are the politics and aesthetics involved in synthesized voices? What happens during the listening experience when the voice we hear is synthesized? What are the notions of identity, personhood and will that we ascribe to the synthesized voices talking to us?</p>

<p>Synthetic voices are artificial voices generated by algorithms. Currently, the designed synthesized voices that we hear in our everyday life seem to have only one vocal identity. In multivocal we question the aesthetic design as well as the representational modes of these synthesized voices, and ask: since voices from machines are not limited to a single vocal identity, why do the currently available synthesized voices have only one gender, one age, and one accent?</p>

<p>multivocal aims to produce reflections on the implications resulting from a single synthesized voice identity, and create new listening experiences to improve and reimagine human and machine relationships.</p>
