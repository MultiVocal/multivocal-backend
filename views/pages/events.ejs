This paper did not include the multivocal voice, instead we asked listeners to annotate and rate the synthesized voices from the IBM Watson Catalogue in order to map the listening experiences of existing synthesized voices. This research project was made in collaboration with researchers from Complex & Intelligent Systems, Passau University.

        <h3>multivocal at ACSIS 2017</h3>
        multivocal was be presented in the session Suspensions â€“ Mobilizing Art and Aesthetics in Cultural Research at the ACSIS conference in June 2017
        This session grappled with the ways that art can be related to research practice within the diverse fields of cultural studies. It examined the role of subjectivity as well as various methodological entanglements of theory and empirical material. What happens when artistic practices are combined with the research practices of Cultural Sciences/Cultural Studies institutions? What happens when the practices of disciplines like visual culture, ethnology and cultural analysis are enmeshed with artistic practice? The session came from a workshop including cultural researchers and practicing artists held at The Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences at Lund University in October 2016.

        Organisers: Max Liljefors and Robert Willim, Lund University.
